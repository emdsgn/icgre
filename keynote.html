  <p class="body">Mark Jaksa is Professor of Geotechnical Engineering in the School of Civil, Environmental and Mining Engineering at the University of Adelaide, Australia.  He has been an academic for more than 30 years, before which, he spent 4 years practicing as a consulting geotechnical and civil engineer in Adelaide and Canberra in Australia.  He has a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree in Civil Engineering and a PhD, both from the University of Adelaide.</p>
  <p class="body">He has published more than 170 papers, chapters and reports on various aspects of geotechnical engineering research and teaching.  His primary areas of expertise are in the characterisation of the spatial variability of soils, probabilistic analyses, artificial intelligence, ground improvement, unsaturated soils and enhancing learning in geotechnical engineering.  He has received several awards recognising his contributions to learning and teaching in geotechnical engineering.</p>
  <p class="body">Mark is a former Chair of the Australian Geomechanics Society and immediate past Vice-President for Australasia and Treasurer of the International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering.  He is also a past Chair of the ISSMGE’s Technical Committee, TC306, on Geo-engineering Education and a member of TC304, on Risk Assessment and Management.</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. Miglio is a hydraulic and pipeline consultant engineer, and currently he is the research manager and an instructor at the Center for Underground Infrastructure Research and Education (CUIRE), The University of Texas at Arlington, TX, USA.</p>

  <p class="body">He earned his M.Sc. in Civil Engineering <i>cum laude</i> in 1999 and his Ph.D. in Hydraulic Engineering in 2005, both from the Università della Calabria, Italy. He was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Soil Conservation, Università della Calabria, Italy.</p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Miglio has more than 10 years of professional experience in the field of structural design of buried pipes/culverts and hydraulic structures design. About the pipeline field, his areas of expertise include: structural design of pipelines, culverts and soil-steel composite bridges; analysis and modeling of soil-structure interaction of buried structures by 2D and 3D finite element method; pipeline material selection and pipeline installation; lightweight backfilling materials; pipelines and tanks tightness testing; damage degree classification of buried pipes; structural rehabilitation of drinking water mains and sewerage systems.</p>

  <p class="body">He has been the project manager for operating in maintenance, repair and reconstruction of underground networks. He has been cofounder and partner of HYDRALAB Ingegneria, a professional engineering association operating in the design of hydraulic structures.</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. Miglio has over 20 publications and he is active in various technical committees of the <i>American Society of Civil Engineers</i> (ASCE) and <i>Transportation Research Board </i>(TRB). He is also an Associate Editor of <i>ASCE Journal of Pipeline Systems Engineering and Practice</i> and <i>ASCE Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering.</i></p>

  <p class="body">He was the recipient of the ASCE/EWRI 2017 Best Reviewer Award and he was selected by the Editor-in-Chief of the <i>Journal of Pipeline Systems Engineering and Practice</i> as an ASCE Outstanding Reviewer in 2013, 2015 and 2016.</p>
